## Registers
```
Registers with an "E" prefix, like EAX, represent the lower 32 bits of the corresponding register in x86 (32-bit) architecture.
Registers with an "R" prefix, like RAX, represent the 64-bit version in x86_64 architecture.

RAX: Accumulator Register, used for arithmetic, logic, io operations, etc.
RBX: Base Register, used as a pointer to data.
RCX: Counter Register, often used to store loop counters.
RDX: Data Register, used in arithmetic operations and io operations.
R8 to R15: Additional General-Purpose Registers

RSI: Source Index, often used as a pointer to the source in stream operations.
RDI: Destination Index, often used as a pointer to the destination in stream operations.

RSP: Stack Pointer, top of the stack.
RBP: Base Pointer, base of the stack frame.
RIP: Instruction Pointer, next instruction to be executed.
```
## Passing arguments on the stack
### 64 bit
```
In the C calling conversion
RDI, RSI, RDX, RCX, R8 and R9 registers and anything additional will be placed in to the stack.
